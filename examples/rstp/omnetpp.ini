#
#	BEB1RootByMAC. BEB1 will be root because of its lower MAC number. Cost criterion can be checked here too. BEB6 will prefer BEB4 because of the shortest path.
#	BEB3RootByPriority. BEB3 will be root because  of its lower switch priority number.
#	BEB2to7BySrcPriority. Source switch priority test. BEB2 will prefer BEB7 because of its better priority (lower priority number).
#	BKandAlteranateLinks. Backup link and an alternate link.  7====5   and 2=autoconnected
#	TopologyChange. BEB1 appears and disappears because its hellotime is 10s.
